# - %seconds% - Slowmode duration
# - %player% - Target player name
# - %name% - Player/target name in GUI titles

# GUI TEXT vs CHAT MESSAGES
# ============================================================================

# IMPORTANT DISTINCTION:
#
# ItemStack display names/lore (GUI elements):
# - Use § color codes via ItemBuilder
# - Example: new ItemBuilder(Material.SWORD).name("&cKill Mobs")
# - This is CORRECT practice for GUI items
#
# Chat messages (user feedback):
# - Use Lang.send() with MiniMessage format
# - Example: Lang.send(p, "modgui.perf.kill-mobs", ...)
# - This allows translation and proper formatting
#
# GUI titles (translatable):
# - Use Lang.get() with & color codes
# - Example: Lang.get("modgui.actions.ecsee-title", "&8EnderChest: %name%")
# - This allows translation while keeping visual formatting

# INTEGRATION NOTES
# ============================================================================

# The ModGUI system integrates with:
# 1. ChatSyncManager (for network chat control via RabbitMQ)
# 2. MuteService (for cross-server muting)
# 3. PlayerNotesManager (for staff notes on players)
# 4. ModGuiConfig (for world-specific settings)
# 5. ModBridge (for cross-server moderation actions)

# Network features (via ChatSyncManager):
# - Clear chat (broadcasts to all servers)
# - Global mute toggle (syncs across network)
# - Slowmode (syncs across network)

# Cross-server features (via ModBridge):
# - Ban, kick, kill, heal, feed
# - Freeze, vanish, gamemode toggle
# - All actions sync across network when bridge is available
