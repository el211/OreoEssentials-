# TempFly Configuration
# Choose which systems to use (you can enable both)

# Option 1: Permission-based groups
# Players need permission: oe.tempfly.vip (or whatever you name the group)
use-permission-groups: true

permission-groups:
  vip: 300      # 5 minutes
  premium: 600  # 10 minutes
  elite: 1800   # 30 minutes

# Option 2: LuckPerms group-based
# Plugin automatically detects player's LuckPerms primary group
use-luckperms-groups: true

luckperms-groups:
  vip: 300      # 5 minutes (if player is in "vip" group)
  premium: 600  # 10 minutes (if player is in "premium" group)
  elite: 1800   # 30 minutes (if player is in "elite" group)
  default: 180  # 3 minutes (fallback for default group)

# Notes:
# - Times are in seconds
# - If both options are enabled, permission groups are checked first
# - Use permission "oe.tempfly.infinite" for unlimited fly time
# - Players in creative/spectator mode are not affected
